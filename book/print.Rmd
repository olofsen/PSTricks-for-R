# Printing

If the `PSTricks` object, manipulated or not, is not assigned to a variable,
it will be `print`ed, that is,
the `print` function for the object will be called with the object as its
argument.

So with
```{r eval=FALSE}
PSTricks()
```

`print.PSTricks()` will be called, which calls `ppwrite()`, and then
exits silently. The latter function does the following:

- closes a `pspicture` if one was open;
- closes the LaTeX document constructed in the `lines` attribute of the `PSTricks` object;
- writes an actual .tex file;
- calls a LaTeX engine to create a .pdf unless requested not to do so;
- crops the .pdf if requested;
- creates a .png if requested;
- creates a .eps if requested (see "examples/toeps.R");
- cleans up unless requested not to do so.

So by default, a .pdf is generated. And by default, the name is the same as the name
of the running R script.

See the main documentation for the options of `ppwrite()`.
