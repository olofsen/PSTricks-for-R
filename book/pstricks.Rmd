# Basic PSTricks Objects

So drawing is done by creating a PSTricks object, a picture, and a line or
another graphical object:

```{r}
PSTricks() %>%
    pspicture(4,2, par="showgrid=true") %>%
    psline(c(4,0,2), c(2,1,0), "linewidth=2pt,linearc=.25", "->") %>%
    endpspicture() %>%
    print("pstricks-psline", topng=TRUE)
```
```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("pstricks-psline.png")
```

From a puristic viewpoint, `pspicture()` with `endpspicture()` are
used with basic PSTricks macros. In most examples with the present
package, `pppicture()` is used to avoid all `endppictures()` in the
example code. Also, in this example, `pspicture()` is not strictly
mandatory because with the "topng" option, the output will be cropped
(otherwise the size will be a whole page).

## Arguments

With `psline` as an example, the original syntax is

```{r,eval=FALSE}
\psline*[par]{arrows}(x0,y0)(x1,y1)… (xn,yn)
```

In R, the definition is:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
psline <- function(p=NULL, x, y, par=NULL, arrows=NULL, star=FALSE) { … }
```

So the nice delimiters with the macros ('{arg}', '[arg]', '(x,y)') could
unfortunately not be retained.

Importantly, all `x` and `y` values are combined in vectors, the most
often used argument "par" follows, and the less used "arrows" and
"star" are at the end. This often saves the typing of "par=…".  If an
argument is NULL, it will not be added to the macro call.  The unit of
a number is usually "cm", but sometimes parameters, usually those that
are not `x` or `y` and are passed unmodified to the PSTricks macros,
may contain a unit and for example "pt" or "mm" may be specified.

As may be expected, `?psline` at the R prompt shows the function definition.

## Wrappers

Almost all basic PSTricks macros have been wrapped. Most additional
PSTricks packages have not been layered. Documentation "pst-user.pdf"
has been used as the main reference. All the information about `par`
is as is, as this it is just a string. Some comments regarding specific sections:

- 2: additional function `ppnewrgbcolor()` which handles R color specifications
- 4: `pssettolength` and `psaddtolength` not wrapped
- 6: later macro `\psTextFrame` wrapped
- 7: later macro `\pscircleOA` wrapped
- 11: "pst-plot" not layered (except `psaxes()`), although `\fileplot`
      is used by `*P2E(fileplot=TRUE)`
- 23: `\KillGlue` and `\DontKillGlue` not wrapped
- 25: "multido" not layered
- 30: "pst-node" layered (see example below)
- 35: `\psmatrix` not layered
- 37: "pst-tree" not layered
- 46: "pst-fill" not layered
- 47: "pst-3d" not layered
- 48: "pst-coil" layered
- 49: `\SpecialCoor` not layered, but see Chapter \@ref(options).
- 50: overlays not layered
- 51: "pst-grad" not layered
- 52: "pst-text" not layered
- 53: "pst-char" not layered
- 55: "pst-eps" partly layered, see Chapter \@ref(options).
- A: `everypsbox()` wrapped

## ppappend

If a wrapper function is not available, the macro or any other LaTEX command may
be supplied as a string to the `ppappend()` function which adds the argument
string to the "lines" attribute of the `PSTricks` object.

## pst-node

Also for the additional PSTricks package "pst-node" calling the macros
from R may be useful, because even though node names replace coordinates,
calculations on the node defining coordinates are possible, as in the
following example. Not the addition of "pst-node" to the "pstpkgs"
argument of `PSTricks()`.

```{r,cache=TRUE}
p <- pppicture(PSTricks(pstpkgs="pst-node"),8,4,par="showgrid=true")

f <- function(p,x,y)
{
    p %>%
        cnodeput(x,y,"A","A") %>%
        cnodeput(x+2,y,"B","B") %>%
        cnodeput(x+4,y,"C","C") %>%
        ncline("A","B",arrows="->") %>%
        ncline("B","C",arrows="->")
}

p <- p %>% f(2,3) %>% f(2,1) %>%
    print("nodes", topng=TRUE)
```
```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("nodes.png")
```
