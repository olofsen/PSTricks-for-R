# The Document

The last example of the previous chapter creates the following
LaTeX document:

```{r}
print(geom_dots(PSTricks(),aes(x=wt,y=mpg),mtcars),"test",topdf=FALSE)
cat(system("cat test.tex",intern=TRUE),sep='\n')
```

The document lines are held in the "lines" attribute of a PSTricks object,
and written to a .tex file when the object is printed.

The package provides functions to open and close a document
(`ppopendoc()` and `ppclosedoc()`), but these are called automatically
when needed.

The arguments of the `PSTricks()` function allow for some control
of the preamble.

By default, a picture is centered by using horizontal and vertical
offset parameters.

A "pspicture" environment is created (see the next Chapter)
automatically in this case, with a default size, and the `geom_dots()`
function is responsible for the necessary basic PSTricks macro calls.
