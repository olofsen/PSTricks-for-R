# PSTricks-for-R

The package "PSTricks" implements layers in the R language above the PSTricks macro
package for LaTeX (and TeX) by providing wrapper functions for many of the macros.

Higher-level functions are also available to produce plots,
including some "ggplot2"-like functions with a similar,
but not completely identical, functionality.

When using these functions, an R object is created with the associated LateX lines,
which is by default automatically converted to a PDF document.

A more complete description is given in
